                                    every time prostitutes were murdered inside them . The trick basically consisted of
                                    trapping a sex worker in a car, shooting the vehicle until it burst into flames, and
                                    then ordering a replacement from Mors Mutual Insurance. Apparently, the problem was
                                    due
                                    to a particularity in the programming of the characters, which meant that the car

                                    not disappear and, therefore, was duplicated.</p>
